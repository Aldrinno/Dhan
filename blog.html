            On my first day with my intern buddy, Jay, Ma'am Ly oriented us on the rules and regulations of the Commission on Audit that we must follow. She then introduced us to the other staff members of COA - DepEd Sorsogon Division Office. They were very friendly and always greeted us with a smile. In the middle of our introductions, the state auditor called for an emergency meeting to announce the upcoming change of state auditor in February, which saddened the employees due to the possible changes that might occur. After that, we were given reading materials about COA Circular 2012-001.

                    In the following days, we were assigned to the TESDA-COA Division - Sorsogon to assist in post-auditing transactions from the previous year, 2024. These included payments for JO wages, assessments, training costs, travel, and more. We were taught how to audit each transaction, review computations, check submitted requirements through a checklist, and correct any errors in the computations since the deadline submission is approaching. That's why we were given separate working papers and months to post-audit.

                    During this task, I gained hands-on experience in reviewing documents thoroughly and applying the auditing principles I learned. It was challenging at first, as I had to familiarize myself with the various transaction types and ensure all supporting documents were complete. However, I found the process rewarding, as I could identify mistakes and make necessary corrections, improving the overall accuracy of the reports. Working under a time constraint also taught me how to manage my tasks efficiently, prioritize important tasks, and collaborate with my fellow intern and instructor for better results. This experience gave me a deeper appreciation for the importance of attention to detail and professionalism in auditing.

            In the past few days, I have learned two things. First, I gained more knowledge on how to perform post-auditing for each transaction. Second, I learned the importance of being professional in respecting other people's time, as we all have different circumstances, situations, and challenges each day. Therefore, it is crucial to follow the proper time management. Above all, it is important treat everyone with respect.

            This week, I had the opportunity to work at the TESDA Provincial Office under the COA Department, where we focused on post-auditing the Private Education Student Financial Assistance (PESFA) files. By Friday, January 31, 2025, we successfully completed auditing the PESFA files and were commended by our instructor for our efficiency in getting the job done. This recognition made me realize how important it is to manage time well, especially when faced with deadlines. I learned that efficiency doesn‚Äôt just mean working fast but also working smart, ensuring quality while still meeting expectations.

                    On a more personal note, this week was particularly bittersweet because it was our final week working alongside Ma‚Äôam Jen, our State Auditor and Team Leader, and Sir Miko, our City State Auditor. They are both transferring to Legazpi due to the reshuffling of state auditors. Throughout the internship, their guidance was incredibly valuable‚Äînot just in terms of technical auditing skills but in terms of professionalism and work ethics. I realized that learning from their experiences has been one of the most rewarding parts of this internship. It wasn‚Äôt just about auditing procedures, but about understanding the responsibilities that come with public service and the impact we can have in ensuring accountability.

This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me how to handle pressure, the importance of attention to detail, and the value of mentorship in the real world. These are lessons I will carry with me throughout my career.

                    This week has been a mixture of exhaustion and excitement‚Äîexhaustion due to the overwhelming number of documents that needed post-auditing, as well as the responsibility of ensuring that every detail was checked, from attachments to computations. Every file had to be meticulously reviewed to ensure accuracy and compliance with regulations, and that was no easy task. The excitement, however, stemmed from the opportunity to take on new tasks that would contribute to our accomplishment report, which made the work feel all the more rewarding.

                    This was also the week when I truly felt the camaraderie and support of our mentors. The kindness and encouragement extended by Ma‚Äôam and Sir made us feel more like colleagues than interns. They consistently greeted us with a warm smile and made sure that we never felt like outsiders. Their positive attitude and willingness to guide us made the work environment both productive and enjoyable. During this week, I continued with the post-auditing of 101 files, checking for incorrect attachments, missing details, and wrong computations. It was a crucial task, as I needed to ensure that the files were complete and in line with established guidelines. Upon completing this, we were tasked with drafting the Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), which would document all discrepancies, such as unsubmitted files, incorrect computations, and other errors identified for each transaction.

            On February 5, 2025, I was reassigned to a different task, putting a temporary halt to the post-audit of the 101 files. I was given the responsibility of reviewing the report issued by an agency, spanning from January to December last year, and checking for any unsubmitted Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting documents. The goal was to include these findings in the AOM once completed.

This task required a keen eye for detail, as I had to ensure that the agencies met their reporting deadlines, which was crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability and monitor unsubmitted files that must be submitted.

        <p class="text-lg mt-2 max-w-7xl mx-auto text-gray-700">
            One of the most memorable moments of my OJT journey so far came this week when Ma‚Äôam and Sir encouraged us to apply for a permanent position after graduation. They expressed confidence in our ability to handle the work and we have a strong potential doing those tasks that will contribute to the agency. For me, this was an immense honor. To be recognized by such professionals as capable of working alongside them in a government agency was a validation of all the effort and hard work I have put into this internship.

            This week, I gained some valuable lessons both academically and mentally. On the academic side, I really saw how important it is to pay close attention to every little detail when reviewing documents. Making sure every attachment, computation, and requirement is accurate and follows regulations isn‚Äôt just important for the task itself, but for maintaining the integrity of the whole auditing process. Mentally, I learned a lot about perseverance and staying focused, even when the workload feels overwhelming. Juggling exhaustion and excitement showed me how to handle stress while staying motivated by new challenges and the chance to grow. I also learned how essential it is to stay organized and efficient, and how helpful it is to lean on the support of colleagues and mentors during tough moments. This week, I realized that being adaptable and resilient is key‚Äîboth in school and in the professional field that I chose to be with.

                    This week, As I continue entering the world of Auditing, I found myself both excited and apprehensive. As a Financial Management, I had gained a good foundation in school, learning about financial statements, auditing procedures, and the importance of internal controls and highly attentive to every details and such. This week, I was assigned to post-audit the remaining month of 2024 of 101 files for a PO agency that I already started last week.  </p>
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-2">
                    This task required me to review the transactions to create an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM). This document would outline the findings of  what I audited, including unsubmitted files, missing attachments per transaction, incorrect computations, and discrepancies in the claiming of allowances for every travel. With this, I had to carefully input detailed information about the payees involved, the amounts, the dates, and the agencies to which they were assigned, all to be submitted for further review to higher position up to state auditor. This exercise revealed the complexities of the auditing process, the need for accuracy, and the importance of ensuring that all documentation is complete and compliant. At times, the task felt overwhelming, especially when faced with numerous files to review, but it was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of how theoretical knowledge is applied in real-world scenarios.

The "ma'am and sir" figures who guided us were not just mentors in auditing, but they also shared valuable career advice, offering us insights into the right path to pursue in our professional journeys. Their support was constant, from giving practical tips on audit techniques to offering words of encouragement. Amid the work, there were moments of lightheartedness and camaraderie, where jokes were shared and the atmosphere was filled with positivity, making the challenging tasks a bit more bearable. On a personal note, I would like to extend my gratitude to Sir for the free snacks that brought an extra layer of warmth to our daily routines.

                    On my Sixth week of my internship at Commission on Audit,  As I progress in my internship at the Commission on Audit (COA), I continue to gain invaluable experiences that have allowed me to grow professionally and personally. The learning process has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am slowly gaining confidence in handling various tasks with efficiency and accuracy. This week, I would like to provide an update on my journey, specifically on my work with the post-audit files, the challenges we faced, and the lessons I have learned along the way.

                    I was tasked to post-audit PO-101 set of  file
s. A task that provide me a comprehensive introduction to the world of auditing, as it involved detailed checks to ensure compliance with established guidelines, regulations, and documentation requirements. After completing this set of PO-101 files. I was assigned to post-audit another set of 101 files but from different agency, which is BNVTS. I was entrusted with the working papers of this set of files because I had already familiarized myself with the agency‚Äôs transactions, checklist, reporting, attachments, and other relevant materials during my previous tasks. This trust was not only a testament to the progress I had made but also a reflection of the growing responsibility I was entrusted with.

            Due to an approaching deadline for completing the post-audit work for multiple agencies to create (AOM) Audit Observations Memorandum for our findings in each agency who haven't yet complied, Our team worked over the weekend to ensure we could finish on time.

            By the time I reached the sixth week of my internship, I began to notice a significant shift in how I approached my tasks. In the earlier weeks, I was uncertain if I could manage the complexity and workload associated with the COA's work. However, as I continued to receive guidance from my mentors and read through relevant circulars and guidelines, my confidence grew. I no longer felt overwhelmed by the tasks at hand; instead, I embraced them with a renewed sense of understanding. This experience has shown me that the pressure I initially felt was natural, especially in a new environment, but with the right resources, guidance, and patience, it was possible to overcome those challenges. I also  learned that by approaching each task with diligence and  focus on continuous learning, one can succeed in a fast-paced and demanding work environment like COA.

        As I reach the ninth week of my Internship, I've taken some time to reflect on my progress, transition, and realizations from the world academic world into the realm of government work and public service. This shift has been both challenging and enlightening, providing me with a deeper understanding of how the theories and lessons learned in the classroom are applied in a practical setting. At first, the complexity of government processes, guidelines, standards, and the level of precision required in completing tasks seemed overwhelming. However, through the guidance of our excellent mentors both from academe and Intern mentors, I've come to appreciate the importance of attention to detail, accountability, and adaptability in this field.

    <p class="text-lg mt-2 max-w-[90%] mx-auto text-gray-700">
        Adding to this week's happening, a new set of files from different agencies have arrived. These files contain different transactions from procurement, travel, salaries and wages, allowances, accounts payable, and etc.... As these files arrived, it just means a new set of files need to be audited. In the midst of doing post-auditing, Ma'am Janela, our Practicum Instructor and CBE Associate Dean, together with Ma'am Cuevas, came to visit us. We had a quick chill chat with regards to how we are doing as an intern with our mentor in the field. The feedback and insights we've received from Ma'am Janela and our mentor have shown me how much I've grown and other areas where I can still improve. As I move forward, I'm more motivated than ever to continue developing my skills, guided by the lessons I've learned and the feedback I've received.

        This week, I continued working on post-auditing for the remaining set of files. Meanwhile, the state auditors were diligently reviewing the AOM's prepared by Ma'am Ly and Sir Armen based on our findings from the post-auditing process and their findings aswell. Once I finished my post-auditing tasks, I was assigned by Ma'am Rea, one of the state auditors, to verify the Report on Supplies and Materials issued. I also needed to input the serial number, date, amount, making sure it is tallied and complied with the guidelines for procurement, my findings and input it into her working paper on the spreadsheet. This required me to revisit the files to locate procurement transactions from the set of documents submitted by various agencies.

    <p class="text-lg mt-2 max-w-[90%] mx-auto text-gray-700">
        After completing this task, I was given a new responsibility: tallying the official receipts and deposit slips for the Report on Cash Disbursement Vouchers. I carefully checked if the different agencies had complied with the requirements and accurately tallied their official receipts and deposit slips in their transactions.

        This week, I noticed the workload felt lighter compared to previous weeks, as we are nearing the end of the auditing season for TESDA. With only a few weeks left, we‚Äôre now preparing for the next phase, which involves transferring to the Division Office to assist with the audit of schools in Sorsogon. I‚Äôm excited for the remaining weeks of my internship, eager to learn more and contribute to the team‚Äôs success in wrapping up this auditing season.
